# 🌐 Prompt-Driven Site Generator
_A GenAI Summer Bootcamp 2025 Project (GLA University)_

---

## 📌 About the Project
This project is a **Prompt-Driven Site Generator** – you simply **give a prompt**, and our system automatically generates a **basic website** for you.  

Example:  
- Input prompt → "Build me a portfolio site with About, Projects, and Contact"  
- Output → A ready-to-use HTML/CSS website with the requested sections 🎉  

The aim is to explore how **Generative AI can accelerate web development** by turning natural language into functional code.
